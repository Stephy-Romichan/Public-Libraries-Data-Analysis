# 📚 Public Libraries Data Analysis

This project analyzes public library datasets to uncover patterns in accessibility, service distribution, and regional disparities. Through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and interactive visualization, we aim to better understand how libraries serve different communities.

## 📂 Project Overview

- **Course**: IE6600 Computation and Visualization for Analytics  
- **Semester**: Spring 2025  

## 🗂️ Dataset

- **Source**: data.gov
- **Content**: Library locations, population served, collection size, internet access, staffing, and budget-related data

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform thorough data cleaning and preprocessing
- Explore regional trends in library resources and usage
- Visualize service gaps and concentration using geospatial techniques
- Provide actionable insights for policy and infrastructure planning

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `plotly`, `folium` for interactive maps
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Insights

- Visual comparisons of urban vs. rural library distributions
- Heatmaps showing population-to-library ratios
- Interactive plots showing variation in services across regions

## 🧪 Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly folium
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/public-libraries-analysis.git
   cd public-libraries-analysis
   ```
2. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Public Libraries Data Analysis.ipynb"
   ```

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Incorporate demographic overlays with census data
- Build a dashboard to visualize live metrics
- Predict underserved regions using clustering
